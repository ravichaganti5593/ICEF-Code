<p style="text-align: justify;"><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">India Canada Economic Forum (ICEF) was founded by a group of students at McGill University in May 2015. It’s aim is to build a dynamic and professional ecosystem in Canada which would engage students, professors, business leaders and politicians to discuss the current trade relations between India and Canada and potential bridging of knowledge and technology gaps in various sectors including economy, defense, manufacturing, health, energy, IT, and processing industries between the two countries. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICEF is an ideal platform for students and professors across universities in Canada to blend with the business leaders and politicians to gauge India’s significant role in the future markets in Asia and across the world and to identify key untapped sectors in which further trade expansions could take place to facilitate exponential growth between India and Canada. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICEF’s mission is to:</span></p>

<ol style="text-align: justify;">
