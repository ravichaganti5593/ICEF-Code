<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>Canada-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Canada-India CEPA negotiations were formally launched on November 16, 2010. Since then, nine rounds of CEPA negotiations have been held in both Delhi and Ottawa. Concluding the Canada-India CEPA remains a priority of the Government of Canada as it would improve market access for Canadian world-class good and services, eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers and boost economic growth for both Canada and India. India represents an important market for Canada, in which there is significant potential for Canadian businesses, particularly in the areas of energy, agriculture, infrastructure and education. The Canada-India CEPA negotiations are in line with the Government of Canada’s Global Markets Action Plan. Canada will continue to support all efforts for the conclusion of the Canada-India CEPA as well as the finalization of the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement.</span></p>
